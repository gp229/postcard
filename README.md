⋅⋅* I chose to create this app because it allows me to practice some frontend development using html5, js, and bootstrap. 
..* App has on-screen instructions within browser. Submit an image, enter 2 email addresses, and hit send. 
..* Created on ubuntu 16.04. Requires php 7.0, webserver(apache2) and email server(postfix).
..* Decided to allow users to add a message anywhere with different text configurations to allow best appearance. 
..* Used a relayhost to gmail as ISP blocks other configuration or you could just have local mail.  https://www.linode.com/docs/email/postfix/configure-postfix-to-send-mail-using-gmail-and-google-apps-on-debian-or-ubuntu/
..* Should work on latest browsers as they support html5 and webRTC. Chrome will requires https for webcam to work unless run on localhost.
